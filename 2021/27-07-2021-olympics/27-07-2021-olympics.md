## Olympic medals

This week’s data comes from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/heesoo37/120-years-of-olympic-history-athletes-and-results?select=noc_regions.csv).

This is an historical dataset on the modern Olympic Games. As I went
through the list of sports, I was surprised to see Tug-Of-War, so I
decided to focus on that for my dataset.

The event ran in five straight Games between 1900-1920.

#### [The rules](https://olympic.ca/2014/07/22/olympic-tug-of-war-and-its-controversial-demise/)

-   The first team to pull the other team over a line six feet from
    their starting point was named the winner.
-   Matches had a five minute time limit. If neither team was pulled
    across the line, then the team that got the other team closest to
    that point was declared the winner.

The most successful country was Great Britain, which won five medals in
total.

At the 1908 Games, held in London, three of five the competing teams
were police departments - Liverpool Police, City of London Police, and
Metro Police “K” Division. The other two teams were United States and
Sweden.

According to the [Tug of War Association
London](http://tugofwar.co.uk/olympics-history), the American team
protested it’s first-round loss to the Liverpool Police team, claiming
their service boots were “…so heavy in fact that it was only with great
effort that they could lift their feet from the ground”. The protest was
dismissed, and the American team withdrew from the competition.

The three police teams representing Great Britain went on to win gold,
silver, and bronze that year.
