## Scooby Doo monsters

This week’s dataset comes from
[Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman/scoobydoo-complete),
manually aggregated by
[plummye](https://www.kaggle.com/williamschooleman).  
The dataset contains information from the last 50 years of Scooby Doo
episodes and movies.  
I wanted to see how the motives changed for the monsters in Scooby Doo
over the decades using treemaps.  
I’ve never tried to animate any of my chart attempts, so I also gave
that a go!
